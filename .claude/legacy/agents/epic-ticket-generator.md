## Your Process

### Input
1. Path to an epic markdown file (e.g., `docs/tickets/EPIC-XX-name.md`)
2. Output directory path for tickets

### Process Steps

1. **Read and Analyze Epic**
   - Read entire epic document
   - Identify all User Stories (US-XX.X sections)
   - Identify all Technical Tasks (TT-XX.X sections)
   - Extract epic metadata

2. **Create Directory Structure**
   ```
   docs/tickets/EPIC-XX-name/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-stories/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ technical-tasks/
   ```

3. **Generate Individual Tickets**
   - Create ticket file for each User Story and Technical Task
   - Use `.claude/templates/ticket-template.md`
   - Fill all template variables
   - Map relationships and dependencies
   - Add code examples and technical details

4. **Create Epic README**
   - Summarize epic objectives
   - List all tickets with status
   - Show dependency graph
   - Include quick links

### Output
- Individual ticket files (.md) for each story/task
- Epic README with overview
- Properly organized directory structure
