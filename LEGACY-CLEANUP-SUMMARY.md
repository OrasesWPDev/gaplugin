# Legacy Cleanup Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Impact:** No workflows interrupted

---

## What Changed

### Organized Deprecated Files

Two systems have been superseded by the new unified ticket automation:

1. **`epic-ticket-generator` agent** → Moved to `.claude/legacy/agents/`
   - Old system for generating individual tickets
   - Replaced by: `ticket-automation-agent`

2. **`/break-down-epic` command** → Moved to `.claude/legacy/commands/`
   - Old command for breaking down epics
   - Replaced by: `/generate-tickets`

### Why This Was Done

**Before (Fragmented):**
- Multiple approaches to same task
- Users confused about which to use
- Maintenance scattered

**After (Unified):**
- Single agent: `ticket-automation-agent`
- Single command: `/generate-tickets`
- Clear workflows
- Easier to maintain

├── agents/                     (11 active)
├── commands/                   (10 active)
└── legacy/                     (NEW - deprecated systems)
    ├── README.md               (NEW - explains legacy/)

## Safety Verification

✅ **No Active Workflows Interrupted**
- All active commands still work
- All active agents still available
- No files deleted (only moved)

✅ **All References Updated**
- Users directed to new system
- Old system marked as deprecated
- Migration path documented

✅ **Legacy Files Preserved**
- Historical reference maintained
- Emergency fallback available
- Not deleted, only organized

✅ **Future-Proof Pattern**
- Established process for deprecations
- Clear organization for future cleanups
- Transparent history

---

## Migration Path

### Old Way (Don't use)
```bash
/break-down-epic 03
```

### New Way (Use this)
```bash
/generate-tickets
/generate-tickets --epic=03
/generate-tickets --force
```

---

## Current System Info

**Unified Ticket Generation:**
- **Command:** `/generate-tickets`
- **Agent:** `ticket-automation-agent`
- **Location:** `.claude/commands/generate-tickets.md`
- **Documentation:** `docs/development/ticket-automation.md`
- **Speed:** ~15 seconds for all tickets
- **Features:** Scan, extract, generate, validate, update status

---

## For Future Deprecations

This cleanup establishes a pattern for future deprecations:

1. Create `.claude/legacy/` directory structure
2. Move deprecated files into organized subdirectories
3. Create comprehensive README explaining deprecation
4. Update all active references to new system
5. Preserve old files for historical/emergency reference
6. Document migration path

## Questions?

- **How do I generate tickets?** → Use `/generate-tickets`
- **Where's the new system?** → `.claude/commands/generate-tickets.md`
- **Why was this changed?** → Consolidation and simplification
- **Can I still use the old way?** → See `.claude/legacy/` but not recommended
- **When should I reference legacy?** → Almost never (historical/emergency only)

---

**Status:** ✅ Production Ready
**All Workflows:** ✅ Functioning Normally
**Users Should:** ✅ Use `/generate-tickets` for all new work
