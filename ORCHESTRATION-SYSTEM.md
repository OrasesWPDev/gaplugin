## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start

```bash
# Orchestrate EPIC-01 with full automation
/work-epic 01

# Orchestrate with checkpoints (pause after each user story)
/work-epic 01 --checkpoint=US

# Manual control (pause after every ticket)
/work-epic 01 --checkpoint=manual

# Show current status
/work-status

# Check detailed orchestration info
/work-status --details
```

### What Happens

1. **Analysis Phase** - Requirements-analyzer analyzes epic
2. **Planning Phase** - Orchestrator creates execution plan
3. **User Approval** - Plan presented, user approves or modifies
4. **Breakdown Phase** - Epic-ticket-generator creates individual tickets
5. **Development Phase** - SWARM parallel execution with git-workflow-specialist commits
6. **Validation Phase** - Wordpress-standards-validator checks each ticket
7. **Testing Phase** - Local-testing-specialist runs security and functionality tests
8. **Quality Gates** - All 6 gates must pass before proceeding
9. **PR Phase** - Creates PR with comprehensive test reports
10. **Monitoring** - Real-time progress updates via TodoWrite

## 📈 Time Savings Example (EPIC-01)

**Manual Sequential Execution:**
- 9 tickets × average 40 minutes = 360 minutes (6 hours)

**Orchestrated with SWARM Parallelization:**
- Phase 1 (3 parallel): 120 minutes
- Phase 2 (sequential): 90 minutes
- Phase 3 (mixed parallel): 60 minutes
- Phase 4 (quality + PR): 30 minutes
- **Total: 300 minutes (5 hours)**

**Time Savings: 60 minutes (1 hour = 17% faster)**

*Savings increase with larger epics (20+ tickets can save 2-3 hours)*

---

## 🛡️ Quality Assurance

### 6 Blocking Quality Gates

1. **WordPress Coding Standards** - PHPCS with WordPress-VIP-Go ruleset
2. **Security Audit** - ABSPATH, nonces, sanitization, escaping
3. **Automated Tests** - Unit + integration tests must pass
4. **No Debug Code** - Prevents var_dump, print_r, etc.
5. **Epic-Level Testing** - Full integration tests
6. **Epic-Level Security** - Comprehensive security scan

**Result:** NO CODE MOVES FORWARD without passing ALL gates

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Checkpoint Strategies

**Situation: First Epic (Learning)**
```bash
/work-epic 00 --checkpoint=manual
```
- Pause after every ticket
- Learn the system
- Understand each agent's role

**Situation: Standard Epic (Normal Work)**
```bash
/work-epic 01 --checkpoint=US
```
- Pause after user stories
- Verify functionality
- Move efficiently

**Situation: Large Epic (20+ Tickets)**
```bash
/work-epic 02 --checkpoint=5
```
- Every 5 tickets = ~3 checkpoints
- Not too frequent
- Enough oversight

**Situation: Well-Known Pattern (Repeatable)**
```bash
/work-epic 03
```
- No checkpoints
- Full automation
- Fastest execution
- After you've done similar epics

## 🎓 Next Steps

### Getting Started

1. Read `docs/orchestration/orchestration-workflow.md` for complete overview
2. Read `docs/orchestration/checkpoint-guide.md` to choose your strategy
3. Run `/work-epic 00 --checkpoint=manual` for your first orchestrated epic
4. Review the plan and approve
5. Watch orchestration progress in real-time

### Learning Path

- **Week 1:** Run 1-2 epics with `--checkpoint=manual` to understand system
- **Week 2:** Run epics with `--checkpoint=US` to build confidence
- **Week 3+:** Run epics with `--checkpoint=none` for full automation

### Monitoring

Use `/work-status` at any time to:
- See current ticket being worked on
- View completion percentage
- Check quality gate status
- See time remaining
- Check for any issues

---

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### If something goes wrong:

1. Check `docs/orchestration/failure-recovery.md`
2. Use `/work-pause` to halt execution
3. Review error messages and recommendations
4. Use `/work-rollback` if needed
5. Use `/work-resume` to continue

### Common Issues:

- **Quality Gate Failed?** → Review the specific gate failure, dev fixes it
- **Test Failed?** → Orchestrator sends back to developer for debugging
- **Merge Conflict?** → git-workflow-specialist handles resolution
- **Agent Offline?** → Orchestrator auto-retries every 5 minutes
- **Dependency Blocker?** → Orchestrator waits, then automatically continues
