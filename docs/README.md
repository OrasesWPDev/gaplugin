## Workflow Overview

### üöÄ NEW: Automated Epic Orchestration (RECOMMENDED)

Use the new SWARM-based orchestrator for fully automated epic execution:

```bash
# Full automation - orchestrator handles everything
/work-epic 01

# With checkpoints - pause for manual review
/work-epic 01 --checkpoint=US

# Manual control - pause after every ticket
/work-epic 01 --checkpoint=manual
```

**What the Orchestrator Does:**
1. Analyzes epic and creates execution plan
2. Breaks epic into individual tickets
3. Develops in parallel where safe
4. Validates quality gates at each step
5. Creates PR when complete

**Time Savings:** SWARM parallelization saves 30-50% of execution time

See: [Orchestration Workflow](orchestration/orchestration-workflow.md) | [Checkpoint Guide](orchestration/checkpoint-guide.md)

2. Verify acceptance criteria
3. Use [Test Procedures](testing/test-procedures.md) to test locally

4. Use `/complete-ticket` command
5. Commit automatically generated with ticket reference

**References:**
- [Quality Checklist](development/quality-checklist.md)
- [Commit Format](git/commit-format.md)

## Key Concepts

### Tickets
- **User Stories (US-XX.Y)**: Feature from end-user perspective
- **Technical Tasks (TT-XX.Y)**: Implementation work supporting user stories
- See: [Ticket System](development/ticket-system.md)

### Epics
- Large feature area, typically 1-2 weeks of work
- Contains 5-10 tickets (user stories + technical tasks)
- One branch per epic for parallel development
- See: [Branching Strategy](git/branching-strategy.md)

### File Ownership
- Each epic owns specific files
- Prevents conflicts during parallel development
- Cross-epic modifications require coordination
- See: [File Ownership](git/file-ownership.md)

### Quality Gates
- Tests that MUST pass before PR merge
- Block PR creation if failing
- Ensure code quality and security
- See: [Quality Gates](testing/quality-gates.md)
