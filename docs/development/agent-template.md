## Filling Out the Template: Step by Step

### Step 1: Agent Name
```
Replace [Agent Name] with:
- Clear, descriptive name
- Use lowercase with hyphens for filenames: "my-agent-name"
- Examples: "epic-ticket-generator", "git-workflow-specialist"
```

### Step 2: Role
```
Replace [One-line description] with:
- Concise statement of what the agent does
- Example: "Manages creation and lifecycle of development tickets"
- Example: "Oversees version control workflow and PR creation"
- Should be one sentence, under 15 words
```

### Step 3: Authority
```
Replace [exclusive control] with:
- What decisions only this agent makes
- What actions only this agent can perform
- Example: "Exclusive control over epic generation and ticket validation"
- Example: "Exclusive authority over Git workflow operations"
- Establishes boundaries and prevents overlapping responsibilities
```

### Step 3.5: Model
```
Replace [assigned model] with:
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (for complex reasoning and implementation tasks)
- Claude Haiku 4.5 (for fast validation and lightweight tasks)
- Exceptional approval required for other models
- Example: **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.5
```

### Step 3.6: Tools
```
Replace [permissions list] with:
- Minimal set of tools needed for this agent's role
- Choose from: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Task, TodoWrite
- Allocate only what's necessary (principle of least privilege)
- Examples:
  - Read-only agent: "Read, Bash" (no write access)
  - Developer agent: "Read, Write, Edit, Bash" (full code access)
  - Orchestrator agent: "Read, Write, TodoWrite, Task, Bash, Edit" (all tools needed)
```

### Step 3.7: Color
```
Replace [emoji color] with:
- Emoji + color name for visual identification
- One emoji + one color name, space-separated
- Examples: üîµ Blue, üü£ Purple, üü¢ Green, üü° Yellow, üî¥ Red, üü† Orange
- Use consistent colors across related agents
```

### Step 3.8: Status
```
Replace [operational status] with:
- Current operational mode or focus
- One sentence description of what the agent is actively doing
- Examples:
  - "Orchestrating GA Plugin development through SWARM methodology"
  - "Implementing WordPress plugins following WP coding standards"
  - "Enforces lean architecture - all reference material must be in /docs"
```

### Step 4: Overview
```
Replace [2-3 sentence overview] with:
- What problem does this agent solve?
- How does it fit into the larger system?
- Who uses this agent and when?
- 2-3 sentences maximum
```

### Step 5: Key Responsibilities
```
Replace [5 responsibility items] with:
- Main duties of this agent
- 3-5 items (not more)
- Format: **[Bold Title]** - Brief description
- Should cover the main aspects of the role
- Examples:
  1. **Ticket Generation** - Create individual user stories and tasks
  2. **Validation** - Verify acceptance criteria and quality standards
  3. **Documentation** - Maintain ticket documentation and relationships
```

### Step 6: Reference Documentation
```
Replace [Documentation references] with:
- Links to all /docs files this agent uses
- Relative paths starting with ../../docs/
- Format: **[Title](../../docs/path/file.md)** - Brief purpose
- Should be 2-4 files typically
- Examples:
  - **[Ticket System](../../docs/development/ticket-system.md)** - Format and structure reference
  - **[Quality Checklist](../../docs/development/quality-checklist.md)** - Validation requirements
```

### Step 7: Integration Points
```
Replace [Agent integration] with:
- List 2-3 other agents this works with
- Explain how they coordinate
- Format: **[Agent Name]:** Brief description of interaction
- Examples:
  - **Git Workflow Specialist:** Receives validated tickets for PR creation
  - **Local Testing Specialist:** Tests generated code before deployment
```

### Step 8: Best Practices
```
Replace [Best practices and anti-patterns] with:
- 3 items in DO section (positive practices)
- 3 items in DON'T section (what to avoid)
- Should be specific to this agent's role
- Examples:
  ‚úÖ DO: Always validate before proceeding
  ‚ùå DON'T: Skip quality checks to save time
```

### Step 9: Metadata
```
Replace [Version], [Date], [Authority] with:
- Version: Start at 1.0
- Date: Current date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Authority: Area of responsibility
- Example: **Version:** 1.0 | **Last Updated:** 2025-10-16 | **Authority:** Ticket Generation
```

## When to Create New Documentation vs. Enhance Existing

**Create new doc when:**
- ‚úÖ Different domain/subdirectory (e.g., docs/automation/ is new)
- ‚úÖ Standalone procedure that doesn't fit existing docs
- ‚úÖ Agent responsible for completely new functionality
- ‚úÖ Documentation would be 1000+ lines if added to existing file

**Enhance existing doc when:**
- ‚úÖ Related to existing agent's domain
- ‚úÖ Extends existing procedures or reference material
- ‚úÖ Falls naturally into existing doc structure
- ‚úÖ <500 lines of new content
