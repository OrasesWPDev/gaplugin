```

---

## When to Create New Agents

**Subagent-Orchestrator decides to create new agent when:**

1. New type of work emerges (e.g., performance testing)
2. Existing agent overwhelmed (delegated multiple to one agent)
3. Specialized skill needed (e.g., API testing)
4. Time savings justifies creation
5. Clear, bounded responsibility

**Example:**
```
Orchestrator: "We need WordPress security auditing"
Subagent-Creator: "Creating wordpress-security-auditor..."
Subagent-Creator: "New agent ready in .claude/agents/"
Orchestrator: "Adding to registry and delegating security audits"
```

---

## Escalation & Override

### When Does Orchestrator Override Agent?

1. **Quality Gate Failure** - Agent's work doesn't pass gates
2. **Dependency Issue** - Blocked by missing upstream work
3. **Resource Exhaustion** - Too many parallel tasks
4. **Timeout** - Agent takes too long

### When Can User Override?

1. **At Checkpoint** - Review and approve/reject
2. **After Failure** - Decide to continue, fix, or rollback
3. **Process Change** - Modify checkpoint strategy

### When Can User NOT Override?

1. **Quality Gates** - Never skip gates
2. **Agent Decisions** - Can't tell agent to do something wrong
3. **Git Operations** - Can't run git commands directly (must route to specialist)
