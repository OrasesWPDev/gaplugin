# TT-01.3: Create Placeholder Class Files

**Ticket ID:** TT-01.3
**Ticket Type:** Technical Task
**Epic:** EPIC-01
**Priority:** P0
**Estimated Time:** 1 hour
**Status:** Not Started
**Blockers:** None

## Description

Create placeholder class files for all core plugin components. These classes will follow the singleton pattern and contain minimal skeleton structure. The actual implementation will be completed in subsequent epics.

These placeholder classes are needed to allow the plugin to initialize without errors while the full implementation is developed incrementally.

---

## Files to Create

- `includes/class-gap-cpt.php`
- `includes/class-gap-meta-boxes.php`
- `includes/class-gap-conflict-detector.php`
- `includes/class-gap-frontend.php`
- `includes/class-gap-admin.php`

---

## Placeholder Structure

Each placeholder class should follow this template:

```php
<?php
/**
 * [Class Description]
 *
 * [Brief description of what this class will do when fully implemented]
 *
 * @package GA_Plugin
 * @since 1.0.0
 */

// Prevent direct access
if (!defined('ABSPATH')) {
    exit;
}

/**
 * Class GAP_[Class_Name]
 *
 * [Detailed class description]
 */
class GAP_[Class_Name] {
    /**
     * Singleton instance
     *
     * @var GAP_[Class_Name]|null
     */
    private static $instance = null;

    /**
     * Get singleton instance
     *
     * Returns the singleton instance of this class.
     *
     * @since 1.0.0
     * @return GAP_[Class_Name]
     */
    public static function get_instance() {
        if (null === self::$instance) {
            self::$instance = new self();
        }
        return self::$instance;
    }

    /**
     * Constructor
     *
     * Private constructor to enforce singleton pattern.
     * Initialization code will be implemented in respective epics.
     *
     * @since 1.0.0
     */
    private function __construct() {
        // Initialization code (to be implemented in respective epics)
    }
}
```

## Class Descriptions

### GAP_CPT
