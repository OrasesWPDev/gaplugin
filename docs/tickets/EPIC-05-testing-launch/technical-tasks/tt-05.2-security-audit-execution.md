# TT-05.2: Security Audit Execution

**Ticket Type:** Technical Task (Security Audit)
**Epic:** EPIC-05 Testing, Polish & Launch
**Time Estimate:** 3 hours
**Assignee:** Security Team

## Description

Execute comprehensive security audit following WordPress security best practices. Verify ABSPATH checks, nonce verification, capability checks, input sanitization, output escaping, and test for common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).

## Audit Checklist

### 1. ABSPATH Checks (30 min)

**Files to Audit:**
- [ ] ga-plugin.php
- [ ] includes/class-gap-activator.php
- [ ] includes/class-gap-cpt.php
- [ ] includes/class-gap-meta-boxes.php
- [ ] includes/class-gap-conflict-detector.php
- [ ] includes/class-gap-frontend.php
- [ ] includes/class-gap-admin.php

**Verification:**
```php
if (!defined('ABSPATH')) {
    exit;
}
```

### 2. Nonce Verification (30 min)

**Check Meta Box:**
- [ ] Nonce field created: `wp_nonce_field('gap_save_meta_box', 'gap_meta_box_nonce')`
- [ ] Nonce verified in save handler
- [ ] Test with invalid nonce (should fail)

### 3. Capability Checks (20 min)

- [ ] CPT requires `manage_options`
- [ ] Meta box save checks `current_user_can('manage_options')`
- [ ] Test as non-admin (should be denied)

### 4. Input Sanitization (30 min)

- [ ] Script content: `wp_kses_post()`
- [ ] Placement: `sanitize_text_field()` + whitelist
- [ ] Scope: `sanitize_text_field()` + whitelist
- [ ] Target pages: `array_map('absint')`
- [ ] Active: Boolean sanitization

### 5. Output Escaping (30 min)

- [ ] Admin columns: `esc_html()`, `esc_url()`, `esc_attr()`
- [ ] Admin notices: `esc_html()`
- [ ] HTML comments: `esc_html()`
- [ ] Script content: NOT escaped (by design, required for functionality)

### 6. SQL Injection Testing (30 min)

- [ ] No direct `$wpdb` queries
- [ ] All queries use `get_posts()` (parameterized)
- [ ] Attempt SQL in fields
- [ ] Verify sanitized

### 7. XSS Testing (30 min)

**Test Cases:**
- [ ] Attempt `<script>alert('xss')</script>` in title
- [ ] Verify escaped in admin
- [ ] Attempt XSS in placement field
- [ ] Verify sanitized

### 8. CSRF Testing (20 min)

**Test Cases:**
- [ ] Remove nonce from form
- [ ] Attempt save (should fail)
- [ ] Modify nonce value
- [ ] Attempt save (should fail)
